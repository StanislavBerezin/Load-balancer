# because we called client, client in docker, so we say
# upstream client
upstream client {
    # then we speciy for nginux server to listen for client
    # on port 3000
    server client:3000;
}

# the same like above to express api
upstream api {
    server api:8080;
}

# this the nginx configuration
server{
    # nginx work on port 80
    listen 80;

# everytime when somebody goes to "/" that is a client, defined
# in upstream above
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://client;
    }
# the same here with with a bit of regex to cut off "/api"
# before sending it.
